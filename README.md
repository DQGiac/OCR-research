Initially intended to be a Container ID recognition with live camera feed. Discontinued but renewed shortly, now developing the ability to recognize other things, such as invoices, number plates.<br>
Developer (80% of all code until now), main data collector/cleaner, main tester.<br>
Currently in development:
<br>- More accurate Container ID recognition in images (primarily because of image preprocessing)
<br>- Faster and more accurate Container ID recognition in videos
<br>- Number plates recognition
